# Project Management

- [x] [Initial Setup](./epics/initial-setup.md)

- [x] [Allow the user to input a US stock symbol or several symbols (eg: AAPL, BABA, BAC, etc...)](./epics/search-stock.md)

- [x] [Pull tweets from StockTwits that mention this symbol (stock symbols usually have a $ before them, like: $AAPL, \$BABA, etc...)](./epics/retrieve-tweets.md)

- [ ] [Display the latest matching tweets. How you display them is up to you.](./epics/show-tweets.md)

- [ ] [When a new tweet comes in, it should automatically be added without having to refresh
      the page.](./epics/push-new-tweets.md)

- [ ] [The user should be able to later add/remove symbols as well. If a user deletes a symbol,
      the matching tweets should also disappear.](./epics/edit-symbols.md)

- [ ] [The page has to be responsive.](./epics/responsive-ui.md)

- [ ] [The number of tweets for a given symbol needs to be represented.](./epics/symbol-tweets-count-buble.md)

- [ ] [Pay attention to details and make the user-interface and user-experience the best you
      possibly can, considering time constraints.](./epics/review-ux.md)

- [ ] [Treat it like a real project, so things like code structure, readability, reusability... should
      be taken into consideration.](./epics/final-review.md)

- [ ] [Setup CI/CD](./epics/setup-ci-cd.md)
