# Project Management

* [Initial Setup](./epics/initial-setup.md)

* Allow the user to input a US stock symbol or several symbols (eg: AAPL, BABA, BAC, etc...)

* Pull tweets from StockTwits that mention this symbol (stock symbols usually have a $ before them, like: $AAPL, $BABA, etc...)

* Display the latest matching tweets. How you display them is up to you.

* When a new tweet comes in, it should automatically be added without having to refresh
the page.

* The user should be able to later add/remove symbols as well. If a user deletes a symbol,
the matching tweets should also disappear.

* The page has to be responsive.

* The number of tweets for a given symbol needs to be represented.

* Pay attention to details and make the user-interface and user-experience the best you
possibly can, considering time constraints.

* Treat it like a real project, so things like code structure, readability, reusability... should
be taken into consideration.

* Setup CI/CD
